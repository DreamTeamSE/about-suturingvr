                        to come in (e.g. if they are scheduled for 9am, come in 
                        at 8:45am)

                                soon, or have they not arrived yet?) and ask her
                                 where you can set up your things (typically a 
                                 room down the hall)</li>

                        Set up the headset and tablet, ensuring that: (you will 
                        need to wear the headset when setting it up)

                                If not, plug them in.

                                Both are connected to and signed into the same

                                ufhealthguest can be used)

                                Casting is working -- you should be able to 
                                “reset headset view” (calibrate) and “launch apps” 
                                from the casting screen.

                                        see these options after tapping in the 
                                        middle of the tablet, this likely means 
                                        the WiFi is not set up correctly

                                        the tablet (black screen), ensure that the 
                                        headset screen is not asleep. If it is not, 
                                        try opening SuturingVR/YouTube and you should 
                                        be able to see it then.

                                The audio on the headset should be put up to max/near max volume.

                        Once set up and tested, the headset and controllers should 
                        be sanitized using a non-alcohol sanitizing wipe.

                                technology of virtual reality (“VR”) in

                                What is virtual reality? Ask them if they’ve used 
                                it before -- if they have, they likely know the 
                                basics of it. If they haven’t, describe it as an 
                                emerging technology where you wear a headset and 
                                are “transported into a virtual world” or something 
                                along those lines.

                                To make the basis of the study (distraction-based therapy) 
                                more understandable: “if you’ve ever listened to 
                                music or watched TV while you were dealing with 
                                some pain or to calm down, VR is just a more 
                                immersive version of that. We're trying to see if this
                                more powerful technology has a greater effect in pain or
                                discomfort reduction.”

                                                There is a spectrum for motion sickness, 
                                                if theirs is mild they can try out VR

                                dizziness, and/or nausea. You will be with the patient 
                                at all times when they are using VR and can stop 
                                the game/take off the headset at any point.

                                                button on the controller

                                        The fit is good when the screen is not blurry, 
                                        ideally they should be able to read the

                                        is that they are comfortable with the game's graphics

                                        it may be able to fit in the headset. Otherwise, 
                                        they may need to try to see if the view is 
                                        comfortable without glasses
                                    </li>

                                        the game if necessary

                                        Have the patient hold their head forward 
                                        and still as they hold the trigger.

                                        This is the second calibration phase. 
                                        If they move/the view is off-center, reset the game

                                                they would be fine holding that

                                                they are good good to go!

                                or less during the procedure, so you will need to 
                                ask the doctor how much they used.

                        If the patient is in the VR group, you will be in the room 
                        with them as they receive the procedure. If they are in the 
                        control group, you will generally not be in the room 
                        (unless you want to be and, more importantly, they are 
                        comfortable with you being there).

                    <li>
                        Once the doctor gets the patient in the position for the 
                        procedure, set up the headset as before and ensure it 
                        is on comfortably.

                        Once the doctor is finished (and you have gotten the local

                        When the patient is ready, go through the post-procedure

                        Patient vitals are collected 30 minutes after the procedure 
                        is completed. You can get them directly from the doctor, 
                        or from the Nurse Manager anytime afterwards as long as 
                        you have the patient MRN.
